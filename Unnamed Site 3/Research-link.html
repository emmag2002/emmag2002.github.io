            <p>TikTok, one of the most  popular social media apps right now, has been around since 2018. TikTok started  out as the app Musical.ly, which came out in 2014. When covid started in 2020,  TikTok became even more famous. &ldquo;TikTok currently represents one of the most  successful Chinese social media applications in the world. TikTok stems from  uses and gratification theory The simple idea of this highly influential theory  is that use of certain media can result in gratification of a person's needs  and only if relevant needs of a person are gratified by particular media, users  will continue media use—here digital platform or social media use.&rdquo; This means  that the more you use TikTok, the more it gratifies your needs. For example,  the more you watch cooking videos, the more cooking videos it will show you.  The funnier videos you watch, the more funny videos it will show you. It can  tell what you like based on which videos you interact with on a particular day. <br>
              According to the article, an  important driver of social media use can be power, hence, reaching out to many  and influencing other people. This is why many people have now been able to  achieve popularity and fame through the use of TikTok. These so called  &ldquo;influencers&rdquo; have been able to become popular and even make money off the  persona they display on TikTok. Rather this be through makeup, vlogs, food, day  in the life content, or many other outlets. It is easy to find some group of  people to follow and enjoy your content on TikTok. <br>
              Another study in the article  shows that a big majority of TikTok users are often young. Young users are also  the most active on the platform. This would make sense considering young people  are often on their phones more often and more susceptible to becoming addicted  to an app. Younger people often have a shorter attention span and with 30 sec-  3 min videos, it makes it even easier to get addicted. <br>
              According to the article, &ldquo;TikTok&rsquo;s unique selling  point is that the content presented to an individual is algorithm-driven and  tailored to their indicated preferences and previously liked content.&rdquo; Also,  according to the article, people seem to have the hardest time of overusing the  app at night. Nighttime is usually when people like to relax and watch some  form of entertainment. Unfortunately, when your form of entertainment is  TikTok, it becomes extremely hard to stop at a certain time and go to bed.  Unlike when you watch a TV show, and the TV show ends so you know to stop and  go to bed. TikTok is never-ending so you could watch it all night and it will  always be something new. <br>
              The article states that &ldquo;TikTok is clearly seen as an  outlet to interact about many serious issues, but often using humor as the  means of delivery. Personal TikTok creators significantly used the full range  of features to execute their message, whereas charity and public health  accounts only engaged a limited amount of features. Consequently, their  engagement metrics were demonstrably lower.&rdquo; This being said, this shows that  even when TikTok tries to be used for educational use, it will never get as  many views as videos that are just for entertainment. People as a whole would  rather be entertained then educated. It is also much easier to sit back and be  entertained then to use your brain to learn something new. <br>
              The last study is about TikTok&rsquo;s effect on self-esteem.  Just like any social media platform, TikTok can effect a person&rsquo;s self-esteem. Especially  younger more impressionable viewers. When someone watches videos of a girl  dancing that gets lots of likes they can think that if they looked like that  girl that they would also get likes. Another type of video that could effect  self-esteem is when people post &ldquo;what I eat in a day&rdquo; videos. These can be very  triggering for some viewers especially when the video is obviously edited and  made to seem like they had a perfectly healthy meal for each meal of their day.  The third type of video that could definitely effect self esteem is the &ldquo;day in  my life&rdquo; videos. These videos are highly edited and only show the highlights of  someone&rsquo;s day. When people watch these they can begin to compare their lives to  the lives they see people on TikTok living. This can be very deceiving and can  lead to sadness and even depression if that person is already susceptible to  depression. <br>
              In conclusion, TikTok definitely had some benefits to  it. Although, TikTok has been seeming to have addictive qualities to it based  on the gratification theory, shortness of video length, age range, and the  types of videos being created. </p>
