<p>When thinking about my favorite brand, Juicy Couture  immediately came to my mind. I have liked Juicy Couture since I was a little  girl. My sister is a lot older than me and I remember her wearing Juicy  Couture. I always looked up to her and wanted to be like her when I grew up.  Juicy Couture has a more personal meaning to me because of that. I love how  simple yet iconic Juicy Couture is as well. Everything is always accented in  pink but the design stays simple. I love that it gives off the early 2000&rsquo;s vibe.  That is why I am choosing Juicy Couture as my design inspiration. I want a pink  accented, simple yet early 2000&rsquo;s feel to my website. I think it will really be  a good representation of my style. <br>
  Juicy Coutures website and Instagram really showcase the simple  yet girly vibe. Their website is simple with accents of pink and lots of  pictures. Their Instagram stays with the pink theme as well as other  light/pastel colors to really keep the girly early 2000&rsquo;s vibe.  <br>
  Probably the most iconic part of Juicy Couture is the font.  The font of the words Juicy Couture looks boujie and rich. This font reminds me  of Medieval royalty. It is meant to give off royal princess vibes which I  really like. I want to do some sort of similar font such as something slightly  cursive for my website. <br>
  What do I plan to use? After looking through the different  fonts and colors on color picker and my fonts, I have decided to do a light  pastel pink background but make the words black like Juicy Couture does. I also  really liked this font on my fonts called &ldquo;hanley pro&rdquo;.  </p>
