      <h2>&nbsp;TikTok, one of the most popular social media apps right now, has been around since 2018. TikTok started out as the app Musical.ly, which came out in 2014. When covid started in 2020, TikTok became even more famous. “TikTok currently represents one of the most successful Chinese social media applications in the world. TikTok stems from uses and gratification theory The simple idea of this highly influential theory is that use of certain media can result in gratification of a person's needs and only if relevant needs of a person are gratified by particular media, users will continue media use—here digital platform or social media use.” This means that the more you use TikTok, the more it gratifies your needs. For example, the more you watch cooking videos, the more cooking videos it will show you. The funnier videos you watch, the more funny videos it will show you. It can tell what you like based on which videos you interact with on a particular day. According to the article, an important driver of social media use can be power, hence, reaching out to many and influencing other people. This is why many people have now been able to achieve popularity and fame through the use of TikTok. These so called “influencers” have been able to become popular and even make money off the persona they display on TikTok. Rather this be through makeup, vlogs, food, day in the life content, or many other outlets. It is easy to find some group of people to follow and enjoy your content on TikTok. Another study in the article shows that a big majority of TikTok users are often young. Young users are also the most active on the platform. This would make sense considering young people are often on their phones more often and more susceptible to becoming addicted to an app. Younger people often have a shorter attention span and with 30 sec- 3 min videos, it makes it even easier to get addicted. According to the article, “TikTok’s unique selling point is that the content presented to an individual is algorithm-driven and tailored to their indicated preferences and previously liked content.” Also, according to the article, people seem to have the hardest time of overusing the app at night. Nighttime is usually when people like to relax and watch some form of entertainment. Unfortunately, when your form of entertainment is TikTok, it becomes extremely hard to stop at a certain time and go to bed. Unlike when you watch a TV show, and the TV show ends so you know to stop and go to bed. TikTok is never-ending so you could watch it all night and it will always be something new. The article states that “TikTok is clearly seen as an outlet to interact about many serious issues, but often using humor as the means of delivery. Personal TikTok creators significantly used the full range of features to execute their message, whereas charity and public health accounts only engaged a limited amount of features. Consequently, their engagement metrics were demonstrably lower.” This being said, this shows that even when TikTok tries to be used for educational use, it will never get as many views as videos that are just for entertainment. People as a whole would rather be entertained then educated. It is also much easier to sit back and be entertained then to use your brain to learn something new. The last study is about TikTok’s effect on self-esteem. Just like any social media platform, TikTok can effect a person’s self-esteem. Especially younger more impressionable viewers. When someone watches videos of a girl dancing that gets lots of likes they can think that if they looked like that girl that they would also get likes. Another type of video that could effect self-esteem is when people post “what I eat in a day” videos. These can be very triggering for some viewers especially when the video is obviously edited and made to seem like they had a perfectly healthy meal for each meal of their day. The third type of video that could definitely effect self esteem is the “day in my life” videos. These videos are highly edited and only show the highlights of someone’s day. When people watch these they can begin to compare their lives to the lives they see people on TikTok living. This can be very deceiving and can lead to sadness and even depression if that person is already susceptible to depression. In conclusion, TikTok definitely had some benefits to it. Although, TikTok has been seeming to have addictive qualities to it based on the gratification theory, shortness of video length, age range, and the types of videos being created. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13591045221106608 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2021.641673/full https://youtu.be/JcB2RsHJZhw</h2>
